🎮 Dodging Game (Python / Tkinter)

A simple 2D dodging game built with Python and Tkinter. The player controls a rectangle and must dodge falling enemies for as long as possible while the game increases in difficulty.

This project was created to practice Python programming, game loops, collision detection, and basic GUI development.

🕹️ Gameplay Overview

You control a blue player block at the bottom of the screen

Red enemy blocks fall from the top

Each enemy you dodge increases your score

The game speeds up over time

You have 3 lives before the game ends

🎮 Controls
Key	Action
Left Arrow	Move left (hold for better movement)
Right Arrow	Move right (hold for beter movement)
Enter	Start the game (from main menu)
R	Restart the game after game over
